In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1.) How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

2.) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

3.) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum, product
FROM BIT_DB.customers 
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


4.) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product,MIN(price) AS cheapest_price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

5.) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product,price*Quantity AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Total_revenue DESC;

6.) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product,Quantity,price*Quantity AS Total_revenue, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


7.) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(acctnum),avg(Quantity * price) AS AVG_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales F
On C.order_id = F.orderID
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
WHERE F.Quantity > 2;

8.) List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product,SUM(Quantity) AS Total_sold,location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

9.) Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT product,location,COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Location like '%New York%' 
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;

10.) How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product,SUM(Quantity) AS Total_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE product like '%headphone%' 
GROUP BY product;

11.) What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity*price)/COUNT(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales F
ON C.order_id = F.orderID
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

12.) What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales F
ON C.order_id = F.orderID
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


13.) Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product,SUM(price * Quantity) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
